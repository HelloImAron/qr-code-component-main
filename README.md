## Overview

## My process

First step was to take a look at the provided HTML and remove any unnecessary stuff, then I went ahead and created a style.scss file
(since working with Sass is waay more intuitive than css) and started to watch it with the Live Sass Compiler extension.
Then I made some variables for the colors and the font size, and from there on, it was basically messing around with flex and grid to
get the content of the page looking as close to the provided design as possible.

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
